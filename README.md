# MultiVNC
MultiVNC is a VNC client that allows multiple screens to be on the same window for moniter many desktops at once. I wrote this when I was a GUI automation engineer so I could monitor all my tests at the same time using VNC so if I can close and reopen the connection so the desktop wouldnt lock.

I have not been in this code for a few years now as I do not need it any more. If there is demand for the app I may continue to support it though. 
The code needs a lot of love and care atm.

Requires my library CSharpWin32Common to build
May also require PsExec (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) for remote machine management functions
