# MultiVNC
MultiVNC is a VNC client that allows multiple screens to be on the same window for moniter many desktops at once. I wrote this when I was a GUI automation engineer so I could monitor all my tests at the same time using VNC so if I can close and reopen the connection so the desktop wouldnt lock.

Requires my library CSharpWin32Common to build
